                  It dynamically adjusts replicas across different ModelServing objects based on overall computing power requirements - referred to as "optimize" behavior in the code.
                  For example:
                  When dealing with two types of ModelServing objects corresponding to heterogeneous hardware resources with different computing capabilities (e.g., H100/A100), the "optimize" behavior aims to:
                  Dynamically adjust the deployment ratio of H100/A100 instances based on real-time computing power demands
                  Use integer programming and similar methods to precisely meet computing requirements

                                    A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                                    relates the key and values.

                              should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                              For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                              "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                              the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                              index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                              referencing a part of an object.
