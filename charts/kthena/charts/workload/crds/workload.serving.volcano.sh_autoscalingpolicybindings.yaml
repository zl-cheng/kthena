                              LabelSelector defines additional label-based filtering for pods that expose metric endpoints.
                              For example: Ray Leader Pods expose metrics but worker pods don't, so use `ray.io/ray-node-type: 'raylet'`.
                              When targetRef kind is `ModelServing` or `ModelServing/Role`, `modelserving.volcano.sh/entry: 'true'` is added by default.

                                    A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                                    relates the key and values.

                              should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                              For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                              "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                              index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                              referencing a part of an object.
